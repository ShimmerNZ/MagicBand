# MagicBand
Arduino base Magicband Doorbell and RFID reader

Very much a work in progress at this stage as still waiting after nearly 8 weeks for some parts to arrive from China to test/complete.

The idea was to produce a doorbell that looked similar to the Disney MagicBand readers for my house. It will include a 433mhz transmitter which I intend to send a signal to my RFXCOM receiver connected to my home automation server to play some Haunted Mansion music.

Video of it while in build mode.
